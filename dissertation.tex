% The graduate school requires that entries are double spaced.
% They also require that multiple lines in a single entry are single spaced.
% This achieves that by setting \baselineskip (the space between lines)
% and \parskip (the additional space between paragraphs) directly, then restoring them
%
% @todo: Find a more elegant way of achieving this

% Establish original spacings
\newlength{\oldbaselineskip}
\setlength{\oldbaselineskip}{\the\baselineskip}
\newlength{\oldparskip}
\setlength{\oldparskip}{\the\parskip}

% Set spacings for these sections
\setlength{\baselineskip}{0.5\oldbaselineskip}
